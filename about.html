			<h5>A little bit about who we are and how it all got started</h5>
			<h6><br>Virtual workout trainer was created by just four people; who thought fitness should be accessible to everyone. They felt like there was a lack of reliable fitness and workouts programs on the web, and too many people in the industry were more focused on monetary gain or appearance than good health.</h6>
